# LIBRARY

This is a javascript project that allows users to add books, delete books, change the reading status. Users can also track how many books are there in the library.
In this project, we developed a simple javascript library application that includes:

- The form uses Bootstrap library for css combined with javascript code
- User can add books to library with the author's name, book title, page numbers and reading status.
- User can delete book from the library.
